          <h2>The Concept</h2>
          <p>
            Your browser can send any data of any form to the server, and the server does not necessarily need to keep it. It can simply be a middle man that relays data you send out to everyone currenltly connected. It has a new role: instead of archiving information, it broadcasts information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Imagine how cool this will be when you can send files...
          </p>
          <p>
            Try it out! Click on the text box and leave a message. See people type as they go...

          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>
            This web application uses <a href="http://socket.io/">socket.io</a> to create full-duplex communication between the client and the server. All data is stored as .json files on the server and is loaded into memory by <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a>. Your typing is simply relayed to other connected users, but once you hit enter, it is recorded by the server.
          </p>
          <hr/>
          <h3>How It Works</h3>
          <p>
          	You can put a stack on any <a href="https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki">Smallest Federated Wiki</a> page, and all of the content broadcast on each individual stack is independent from the others. This app is run along side a SFW farm, and your username is associated with all of the stacks created within a farm.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, you can simply put this on any web server. This demo here is stand-alone. You can integrate it into your page, or you can have an iframe that refers to another server.
