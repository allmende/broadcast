css classes
-----------

These are the classes I took from bootstrap. I am not using bootstrap as a whole, because SFW has extensive styling that Bootstrap interferes with. So, I am just using what I specifically want to use.

It has been significantly tweaked from the standard settings, so things might not work properly if you choose to sub back in Bootstrap.

* accordion
* accordion-group
* accordion-heading
* accordion-toggle
* accordion-body
* accordion-inner

Classes that are more functional than styling:
* collapse
* in
